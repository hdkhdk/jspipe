# JS/Pipe

JS/Pipe is a minimal library that makes it easy to *coordinate complex concurrent* streams of events and other data using *plain* JavaScript. No callbacks or chained functions in sight. 

As a result, stack traces are crystal clear so debugging is easy. You also get to keep try/catch!

JS/Pipe is inspired by Goroutines and Channels, found in the Go language.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

#### Generators
JS/Pipe relies on JavaScript Generators, introduced in ES6. For your code to work in current JavaScript environments you need to use a transpiler that converts ES6 Generator syntax to ES5 semantics. Two popular ways are Google Traceur (which supports not only Generators, but also many other ES6 features like lambda syntax, destructuring, etc.) and Facebook Regenerator (which focuses on Generator support only). 

We use Facebook Regenerator. 


### Building
1. Clone this repo: `git clone git@github.com:jspipe/jspipe.git`
2. Install Grunt if necessary: `npm install -g grunt`
3. Install dev dependencies: `npm install`
3. Build: `grunt build`

Both ES5 and ES6 builds are produced (in the dist-es5 and dist-es6 directories respectively) and for each the build output includes modules in the AMD, CommonJS, and module pattern formats. 






The ES5-compatible files (*.es5.js) have been produced using Facebook's regenerator, a tool
to transpile (ES6) Generator code to ES5. You can get it here: https://github.com/facebook/regenerator
